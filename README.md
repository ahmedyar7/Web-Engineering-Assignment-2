## How to Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ahmedyar7/Web-Engineering-Assignment-2.git
    ```

2.  **Download the Live Server Extension in VS Code (Optional, Recommended)**

    ```zsh
    https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer
    ```

3.  **Open the Project in a Browser (Two Options):**

    ### Option 1: Using VS Code Live Server (Recommended for Development)

    Right-Click on the `index.html` file and select **"Open with Live Server"**.

    ### Option 2: Opening Directly (Alternative/Simple)

    1.  Navigate to the project folder (`Web-Engineering-Assignment-2`) in your file explorer (e.g., Windows Explorer, Finder).
    2.  **Double-click** the `index.html` file.

    *(This will open the form directly in your default web browser, though modern features like live updates and some API interactions work better with a local server like Live Server.)*
