Student Registration - README

This small project demonstrates a semantic HTML5 form and a CSS3 stylesheet meeting the assignment requirements.

Files:
- index.html : The form using semantic tags (header, main, form, fieldset, legend, label, button, etc.) and required controls.
- styles.css : Minimal but modern CSS using variables, grid/flex, responsive units, media queries, focus states and transitions.

How to open:
1. Open the project folder in your file manager or code editor.
2. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your default browser, or right-click and choose "Open with" and select a browser.
3. If you use VS Code with Live Server, right-click `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server" for live preview.

What was implemented (requirements checklist):
- HTML5 and CSS3 only (no JavaScript).
- Semantic tags: `header`, `main`, `form`, `fieldset`, `legend`, `label`, `button`, `footer`.
- Demonstrated controls: input (text, email, tel, date, password, file, checkbox, radio), select, optgroup, textarea, datalist, image (placeholder), progress.
- CSS features: variables, responsive units, grid/flex layout, media queries, custom focus states, transitions.
- Markup validated for labels and helper text; placeholders and titles added where helpful.
- Comments included in HTML and CSS to explain important sections.

Notes:
- All form controls use native validation where appropriate (e.g., `required`, `type=email`).
- The form action is `#` so it does not submit to a server; this keeps the project client-side only as requested.

Grading hints:
- Semantic structure and labels are present for accessibility.
- CSS demonstrates responsive layout and modern features to satisfy the rubric.
